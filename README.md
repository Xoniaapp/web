# `@xoniaapp/webapp`

Welcome to `xoniaapp/webapp`, the frontend for Xonia - a real-time chat application. This repository contains the code for the web-based client for Xonia, built using modern web technologies such as React, TypeScript, Vite, and Zustand.

## Building it

To build xoniaapp/webapp, you will need to have the following tools and dependencies installed on your system:

- Node.js: xoniaapp/webapp is built using Node.js, so you will need to have it installed to build the project. You can download and install Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org/.

- Yarn: xoniaapp/webapp uses Yarn as its package manager, so you will need to have it installed to install the project dependencies. You can install Yarn by following the instructions at https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install.

Once you have Node.js and Yarn installed, you can clone the xoniaapp/webapp repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xoniaapp/webapp.git
cd webapp
yarn
```
This will clone the repository and install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

To build xoniaapp/webapp, you can run the following command:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will build the project and create a production-ready version of the webapp in the build directory.

You can also run the following command to start a development server that will automatically rebuild the app and reload the page when you make changes to the source code:

```
yarn dev
```
This is a useful way to test and debug xoniaapp/webapp while you are developing it.
